# embedding-brain
A neural network library in Javascript, built to support input embeddings alongside ordinary inputs and output probabilities. Developed for personal explorations in machine learning, with general applicability in mind.

## Installation
	
	npm install embedding-brain

### ES6 - *Important*
This library makes some use of features (only generators, currently) of ECMAScript 6. This means that your version of `node` must have support either for the `--harmony` execution flag or come out of the box with support for generators (most recent versions). Please see [the node.js documentation](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/es6/) for more information
